============

Resources and an AngularJS application accompanying my Infotec 2014 presentation on JavaScript Frameworks. If you're new to GitHub, click the "Download ZIP" button on the right to download all the files.

###Demo Application

All source code for the application can be found in /app folder. All dependencies are included. The services in this application load the Infotec track/session data from a third-party site.  If the that third-party site isn't working, sample data is included in the /app/_data folder.
